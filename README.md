# Admin-Dashboard

The purpose of this project is to utilize CSS grid to replicate the layout of an example dashboard designt that was provided by The Odin Project. 

My initial steps include createing a hand sketch to mockup the basic grid layout, including the page's header, sidebar, and main content containers. I then used that sketch to begin adding in the basic elements to the HTML. Then I applied grid properties to the elements in the CSS file to produce a loose page layout from a 2x2 grid.

Then I sketched out the content layout for each section, then added placeholder content in the HTML, and applied grid properties to get each section's layout roughly how I wanted it. 

I then begun replacing some of the dummy content with icons and images, added thematic styling, and added final positioning/layout tweaks.
